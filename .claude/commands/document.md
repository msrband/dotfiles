# Document Code

Please add comprehensive documentation to the code in $ARGUMENTS

For each function and class:
- Add a clear description of what it does
- Document all parameters and their types
- Explain the return value
- Include usage examples where helpful

Follow the project's existing documentation style.
- If it's a Ruby project, use YARD to document it.
